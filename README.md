# News_Manager_QML
## Introduce
+ The version intended for migration to Android phones
+ The latest discovery is that there are no word cloud and jieba libraries on the mobile phone. Therefore, cross-compilation is required. Additionally, a phone with developer privileges is needed. Unfortunately, I don't have such a configuration. Thus, this project can be regarded as a rebranded version of the original News_Manager.

## Notice

+ When running this project locally, you need to first enter "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the command line.

## Operation
+ python main.py
